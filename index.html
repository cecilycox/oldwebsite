                <p style="font-weight:bolder">To the District 23 Delegates for Vice President Joseph R. Biden:</p>

            <p>My name is Cecily Cox and I am running to be a Joe Biden National Delegate to the 2020 Democratic National Convention from the 23rd District.</p>

            <p>If you haven’t met me, I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, and I’ve lived here all my life. I’m a graduate of DISD (Hillcrest High School) and Southern Methodist University (2019).</p>

            <p>Although I just finished college a year ago, I feel I’ve already had a wealth of political experience. At SMU, I served as president of the SMU College Democrats, as African-American Senator on the Student Senate, and as a member of the SMU Speech and Debate Team.  Last election, although still in college, I was working as a summer intern for Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters when I was selected as a delegate and attended the state and national Democratic Party conventions.</p>

            </p>The result that year was disappointing, but I didn’t give up on politics. In recent times, I’ve spent time working as a paid field organizer and advance-team member on state and national campaigns. I’m working now for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, although I plan this fall to start teaching middle school history.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">This is the most important presidential election in my lifetime.</span> I don’t want to have to explain to this generation of children why our country returned to power a president of the United States who sexually assaults women; who repeatedly insults the disadvantaged, including disabled people, African Americans, immigrants, and Muslims; who, over and over, makes inflammatory comments guaranteed to provoke partisan, racial, and religious dissension, if not violence; who thinks a president should act on “instinct,” never relying on experts, briefings, books, or anyone else with an opinion differing from his own; and who, every day, undermines the historic goals of American democracy: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

            <p>Vice-President Biden is our only opportunity to stop this derangement. I hope to support him as a delegate at our national convention this year, and I ask for your help to allow that to happen. Thank you.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">Delegates of the 23rd District, I am asking you to entrust your voice with me</span> to vote for Joe Biden at the National Convention in Wisconsin (or online) this August. Together with Joe, we can achieve victory, and repair the divides in our great nation.</p>

            <p>It would be an honor of a lifetime to attend the national convention on behalf of District 23, and I humbly ask for your support and vote at the state convention in July. If anyone has any questions or concerns, or even if you want to say hello virtually during this time of uncertainty, please feel free to reach out to me on my cell phone: 972-504-1337, or email: ccecilycox@gmail.com. Thank you again for your consideration. I look forward to meeting everyone in-person once this pandemic has come to an end.</p>

            <p>Democratically yours,</p>

            <p>Cecily E. Cox</p>
            <h5 style="text-align:center;margin:auto;">VOTE!</h5>
